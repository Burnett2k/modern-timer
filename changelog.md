### Timer Controls and Background Worker
- Built TimerControls component with Start/Pause and Reset buttons
- Integrated TimerManager with proper TypeScript service worker
- Fixed worker import using Vite's proper syntax (`new URL()` with `import.meta.url`)
- Connected UI controls to actual countdown functionality
- Used proper TimerStatus enum values (no hardcoded strings)

### Testing

### Inline Timer Editing and Bug Fixes
- Implemented click-to-edit timer display with 3 input boxes (HH:MM:SS)
- Added input validation to only allow numeric input (0-9)
- Fixed major bug: timer now starts from user-set duration, not default 25 minutes
- Fixed reset bug: timer resets to user's custom duration instead of hardcoded 25 minutes
- Added keyboard shortcuts: Enter to save, Escape to cancel editing
- Only allows editing when timer is stopped (proper state management)

### Testing
- Verified input validation prevents letter entry
- Confirmed timer starts from correct user-set duration (e.g., 26 minutes)
- Validated reset returns to user's custom time setting, not default
- Tested inline editing workflow with keyboard shortcuts

- Positioned above timer display for better visual hierarchy
- Added "Goal:" prefix for clear labeling
- Implemented click-to-edit functionality with text input, save/cancel buttons
- Added visual cues: dashed borders, hover effects, pointer cursor
- Keyboard shortcuts: Enter to save, Escape to cancel
- Clean design without unnecessary icons or text clutter

### Testing
- Verified goal text displays properly with "Goal:" prefix
- Confirmed click-to-edit workflow for both empty and existing goals

### Browser Tab Integration and Bug Fixes
- Implemented dynamic browser tab title updates during countdown
- Added synchronized flashing behavior for screen and tab when timer completes

- Tab flashes "Time is Up!" / "00:00:00" in sync with screen display
- Improved timer display styling with larger 48px monospace font
- Fixed major bug: Start button after completion now properly resets to user's set duration
- Fixed regression: Restored click-to-edit functionality for timer display
- Clean tab title behavior: no extra text clutter, just essential info

### Testing
- Verified tab shows countdown during timer operation
- Confirmed synchronized flashing between screen and tab on completion
- Validated Start button behavior after timer completion
- Tested timer display click-to-edit functionality
- Confirmed proper state management for all timer operations

### State Persistence and localStorage
- Added comprehensive localStorage system for user preferences and timer state
- Timer automatically resumes if page is refreshed during active countdown
- User's preferred duration and session goals persist across browser sessions
- Implemented data expiration (1-hour limit) to prevent stale state restoration
- Added graceful error handling for localStorage failures

### Testing
- Verified timer resumes correctly after page refresh during countdown
- Tested preference persistence across multiple browser sessions
- Validated localStorage error handling when storage is unavailable

### Keyboard Shortcuts Implementation
- Added F key for start/pause toggle functionality
- Implemented E key for instant session goal editing
- Added T key for instant timer duration editing
- Included R key for reset (preserves Cmd+R browser refresh)
- Smart input detection: shortcuts ignored when typing in text fields

### Testing
- Verified all keyboard shortcuts work in different timer states
- Confirmed shortcuts don't interfere when typing in input fields
- Tested Cmd+R still works for browser refresh while R key resets timer
- Validated F key toggles between start/pause correctly

- Auto-pause feature: editing running timer automatically pauses it
- Consolidated editing logic to eliminate code duplication between click and keyboard
- Fixed React stale closure issues in keyboard shortcuts with useCallback
- Improved prop-controlled editing state for better component coordination

### Testing
- Tested editing timer while running automatically pauses
- Confirmed keyboard and mouse editing paths work identically
