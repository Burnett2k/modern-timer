### Inline Timer Editing and Bug Fixes
- Implemented click-to-edit timer display with 3 input boxes (HH:MM:SS)
- Added input validation to only allow numeric input (0-9)

- Added keyboard shortcuts: Enter to save, Escape to cancel editing
- Only allows editing when timer is stopped (proper state management)

### Testing

- Confirmed timer starts from correct user-set duration (e.g., 26 minutes)
