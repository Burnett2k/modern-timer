- Got confused about directory structure. That should be more explicit when I set things up.
- When Claude generates a bunch of code changes, I'm not sure how to give it inline feedback like a code review.
- Seems to be disregarding my design document suggestions and such.
- I don't like having to review a humongous file. Would be much better if I could interactively code this with Claude more like a pair programmer.
- I should mention a quality check step to use everytime. Remove unused variables, run tests, run linter, summarize code changes, etc.

Hooks:

- useEffect
- useRef
- useCallback
- useState

Concepts: props flow down, events bubble up
Props: data prop, callback prop, control prop

Tips for using claude:

- Clear
- /install github app (code review)
